# Advanced-Physical-Design-using-OpenLANE-Sky130
This repository contains the details of steps followed and summary of hands on done on doing the Advanced Physical Design Using OpenLANE/SKY130 workshop. The workshop focuses on complete ASIC Design flow from RTL2GDS using Open Source EDA tool OpenLANE and Google SKYWater130nm pdk. The core of design PICORV32A used is of RISC-V architechture.
<br /> •	Day 1: Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK
<br /> •	Day 2: Good Floorplan vs bad Floorplan and Introduction to Library Cells
<br /> •	Day 3 - Design library cell using Magic Layout and ngspice characterization
<br /> •	Day 4 - Pre-layout timing analysis and importance of good clock tree
<br /> •	Day 5 – Final Steps for RTL2GDS using TritonRoute and OpenSTA
